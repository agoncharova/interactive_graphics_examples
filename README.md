# Usage examples of the graphical interface in Python

The repository makes use of the Python `turtle` module:
- `turtle_drawing_circles.py`: the program draws circles of random colors counter-clockwise.
- `turtle_racing_game.py`: the program offers a user to bet on a turtle of a certain color. Next, the race starts. Each turn, until one turtle reaches the finish line, turtles make one move between 0 and 10 steps. At the end of the race, the user is notified of the outcome.
